# sql-stram-queue
SQL stream queue implematation - inspired on redis

I have to do some project update on our 10 years old technology, where there is no possibility 
to use some streaming platform like REDIS, KAFKA etc. I wrote simple implementation of streams 
in MYSQL.

You can use it for simple streams like image processing. Unfortunately I don't think that
this implementation will have some powerful performance.

BTW. If your hosting provider doesn't have any streaming platform you can use it!
